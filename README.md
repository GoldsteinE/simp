# Simp  

Simp is a fast and simple GPU-accelerated image manipulation program.

![Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

## Goals

* Support of as many image formats as possible.
* 60 Hz. Avoid blocking for more than 16ms.
* Flicker free redrawing.
* Always use GPU-acceleration where possible.
* Desktop OS support.
* Basic image manipulation.

### Non Goals

* Powerful image manipulation (I am not making the next photoshop)
* Web/Mobile platform support.

## 3.0 Roadmap
- [x] Switch from imgui to egui.
- [x] Redo the checkered background.
- [ ] Hotkey hints in menus.
- [X] Help menu.
- [X] Hue rotation.
- [X] Contrast adjustment.
- [ ] Lightness adjustment.
- [ ] Saturation adjustment.
- [X] More precise cropping.
- [X] Add support for exif metadata.
- [ ] Anti-aliasing (probably multisampling but maybe lanczos resampling on GPU).

1. Building with AVIF support requires the C library dav1d and is therefore not enabled by default.
2. Most common cameras are supported but the colors may look weird because the standard curve may not fit all images.
3. HEIF/HEIC is not supported because it is currently very hard to link libheif on windows.

## System dependencies

System dependencies are only required at compile time.

### Linux
```shell
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libspeechd-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev
```

## Installation

### Cargo

```shell
cargo install simp
```

### Latest from github

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kl4rry/simp
```

The latest bulid is very likely buggy and unfinished.  
You can always also just grab the latest binary from actions build artifacts.

### Manual

Just download the exe from the releases tab. No actual installation is required.
