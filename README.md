## Goals

* Support of as many image formats as possible.
* 60 Hz. Avoid blocking for more then 16ms.
* Flicker free redrawing.
* Always use GPU-acceleration where possible.
* Desktop OS support.
* Basic image manipulation.

### Non Goals

* Powerful image manipulation (I am not making the next photoshop)
* Web/Mobile platform support.

## 3.0 Roadmap
- [x] Switch from imgui to egui.
- [x] Redo the checkered background.

## System dependencies

System dependencies are only required at compile time.

### Linux
```shell
sudo apt-get install libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libspeechd-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev
```

## Installation

### Cargo

```shell
cargo install simp
```

### Latest from github

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kl4rry/simp
```

The latest bulid is very likely buggy and unfinished.  
You can always also just grab the latest binary from actions build artifacts.

### Manual

Just download the exe from the releases tab. No actual installation is required.
